# Automatic-Water-Dispenser-Using-Arduino-
About 71% of the earth is secured with water, yet 2.5% of it is drinking water. With ascend in population, contamination and environmental climate change, it is normal that by 2025 we will encounter water deficiencies. On the off chance that we supplant all the manual taps with a brilliant one that opens and closes without anyone's help, we can spare water as well as have a more beneficial and advanced way of life. Therefore we are making an Automatic Water Dispenser using Arduino and DC water pump that can give us water when a glass is brought close to it. We are using the remaining water after filtration to quench the thirst of animals and birds. The waste water pipe will be attached to a bowl and the bowl will have a sensor which will detect movements of animals. It will fill the bowl whenever it goes below a certain level and accordingly allows the water to flow.
